Why we need good developers
===========================
Even though I won’t be working in the technology industry, I will definitely have many opportunities to engage with developers. For example, during my summer internship last summer at a CPG company, one of the projects that people on my team were working on was developing a new app that can detect the condition of one’s skin and provide recommendations on how to improve the conditions of the skin. With the number of mobile apps exponentially increasing everyday, new apps have to be even more effective in adding value to people’s lives to sustain success. Therefore, knowing how to identify and hire great developers will be an essential skill for me to have. 

Given credible references, I have learned that you get what you pay for. If the project is complex and important to the business needs, it’s better to start off hiring expensive developers to ensure they deliver quality work throughout the whole process. Less experienced developers might run into roadblocks that will be fundamentally too difficult for them to solve. 

Who are good developers?
========================
Great developers will understand both the business and the technology. They should always be learning new languages and techniques. If it’s apparent that they are not curious enough to learn new technology (e.g. if they only know how to program in one language), they are probably not good enough to work with. They need to know how to automate tests and functionalities. On the other hand, they also need to care about the real world problem that the business is trying to solve. They should be partners in solving the problem rather than simply coders of whatever requirements they receive.

Great developers usually are not actively searching for new jobs because they are always in demand and in the process of other projects. Technical meet ups are a great place to meet great developers. People who regularly attend these meet ups are usually people who care about the technology. Once you sign up for a meet up, be patient and don’t be too aggressive (e.g. go in with the intention to get referrals from other attendees).

Questions to ask to find your perfect developer
===============================================
After you find developers, there are some questions to ask to find out if they are a good fit for the business. One, what version control, unit testing frameworks, and programming frameworks do they use? Two, what other alternatives did they also consider using for each? Three, how did they pick the systems they ended up using? Lastly, if the developer can communicate their answers in an easy-to-understand fashion, chances are you have found a good fit.
