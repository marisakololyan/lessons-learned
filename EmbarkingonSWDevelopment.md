Ten Tricks for Embarking on Software Development

1.	Wait as long as possible to start developing software. Don’t build it before you are sure there is viable demand for what you are doing
2.	As technology advances, many things are possible. Do not simply ask whether something CAN be done, ask whether it SHOULD be done
3.	Test the minimum viable product to validate whether there is demand. Try to get a sense for what people will actually pay 
4.	Contract developers with and hourly structure rather than fixed bid
5.	Only ask for an estimate if it’s going to affect the go/no-go decision
6.	Start with the hardest thing first
7.	Specify as you go along rather than everything upfront
8.	Plan to leverage existing platforms whenever possible rather than re-inventing the wheel (example- Shopify)
9.	Establish in advance a weekly meeting with deliverables (if possible) to monitor progress. 
10.	Get the whole team on the same page about agile development best practices
