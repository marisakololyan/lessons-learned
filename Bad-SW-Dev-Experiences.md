Every company I have worked for so far has involved frustrations with IT. 
In my last job, I worked for a large retail organization with a 1000+ person IT group. 
I never understood the strict processes they had for every IT “fix” in the organization: RFP process, 
months of “business requirement gathering”, prioritization process of work, required time length of UAT, etc. 
It all caused considerable confusion between the IT organization and the rest of the business and led to endless conflict. 

I extremely appreciated that IT experts are similarly frustrated with the inefficiencies of the software development 
processes in existence – and was similarly pleased to understand there is a “better” alternative. 
Actually, during software development when I described use-cases to the IT team I found they better 
understood the project from the business perspective. 
I could really see the benefit of using user stories to explain the purpose and intent of software development. 
I also could see the overall benefit to the business – and reducing frustration – in incrementally developing 
software versus BDUF.
