Tips on Creating Lean Start up 

1.  Interview customers on preferences  ( You can have problem space or solution space interviews)
2.  Be fine with coming up with a Minimal Viable Experiment or Product (also known as an MVE or MVP) 
- Your MVP can come in many forms: 
   - Landing Page
   - Flyers  
   - Sample product  
   
3.  Do things that Donâ€™t Scale.  Your product is not for building but for learning.  For instance you can create an e-mail only startup.

4. Decide what is the biggest risk and work to mitigate that risk.
